    <h1>HELLOOOO000 LOVELY</h1>
    <p>
      Yesterday, I told you I would give you a surprise right. But when I was about to start, one of my housemates asked me to go out for a walk and tell him about my LOVE. 
      You know how much I love you, I had to tell about you and our love story haha. 

      See I told you I will never deprive you of my love. Everything I told you was truth, I never lie. I would rather lose you by saying the truth than lie just to be with
      you. I have selfcontrol but I cannot hide my other side. 

      I could write you a message here and have you stalk everyday haha, but I will do this only if my wife gets really angry and goes to her mothers place after blocking me 
      on everything haha. Which really won't happen haha.
      
      I love you my cutie little baby.
