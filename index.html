    <h1>HELLOOOO000 LOVELY</h1>

    <p>
      Yesterday, I told you I would give you a surprise right. But when I was about to start, one of my housemates asked me to go out for a walk and tell him about my LOVE. 
      You know how much I love you, I had to tell about you and our love story haha.
    </p>

    <p>
      See I told you I will never deprive you of my love. Everything I told you was truth, I never lie. I would rather lose you by saying the truth than lie just to be with you. 
      I have self-control but I cannot hide my other side.
    </p>

    <p>
      I could write you a message here every day, which really will not happen this early just because I love with all my heart. 
      But I will do this only if my wife gets really angry and goes to her mother’s place after blocking me on everything haha.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love you my cutie little baby. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Okay, tighten your hair for a true story haha. I feel really bad for the girl I told you about who was with the guy for future security. Every time I pass through her at work, she keeps on looking at me with those innocent eyes. 
      I know the meaning of those eyes, but I cannot do that. Not only because I have you, it is because I will lose self-respect if I do anything dumb like that.
    </p>

    <p>
      The guy she is with is a great man—very respectful, kind, and will be a great husband, father, and provider to her child. But he does not know that she wants to feel seen too by him, wanted by him, flirt with her and lust towards only her and gaze down for any other women beside her. 
      She wants him to not only open the door for her, but also grab her soft cheeks while she gets in; she wants him to throw everything aside and just ravish her respectfully, she wants to feel the depth of grass haha. 
      Guys just want to play video games and go to concert or watch sports games haha. He thinks she is a good girl, she won't like that; of course she is a good girl but for only him she can become naughty too. She is just waiting for him to lead, which he has no clue about. Except for respect and all, this is also what separates us men from women.
      This is the truth, that everybody is scared to speak about. I don't care what anybody thinks about me. It is not her fault for being like that is how we are built, 
      I know many women like that, who will judged by men for showing their true nature but we men are praised for this. Which is all dumb no matter what others say. But self-control and self-respect is most needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      People mistaken solitude for loneliness haha, but solitude leads you to the part of your mind you cannot imagine haha.
